#### by **Mikey Pinaud**

## Description

This will be a launch page that showcases the Alleys Of Your Mind radio show with a logo, past episode images and widgets of which you can listen to, and navigation for upcoming content.

The main inspiration for design comes from this [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/view/2016-page/) page which there will be a main background image spanning vertically in the background while all content will be floating over as you scroll to the bottom of the page.
